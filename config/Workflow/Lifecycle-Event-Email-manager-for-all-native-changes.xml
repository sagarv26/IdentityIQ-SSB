  <Variable input="true" name="trigger">
    <Description>The IdentityTrigger</Description>
  </Variable>
  <Variable input="true" name="event" transient="true">
    <Description>
      The IdentityChangeEvent.  It can be used to build
      the provisioning plan, but does not need to be
      persisted with the case, so marked as transient.
    </Description>
  </Variable>
  <Variable input="true" name="identityName">
    <Description>The name of the identity.</Description>
  </Variable>
  <Variable initializer="script:(identityDisplayName != void) ? identityDisplayName : resolveDisplayName(identityName)" input="true" name="identityDisplayName">
    <Description>
      The displayName of the identity being updated.
      Query for this using a projection query and fall back to the name.
    </Description>
  </Variable>
  <Variable name="plan">
    <Description>The provisioning plan, which is built by a service method. </Description>
  </Variable>
  <Variable editable="true" initializer="false" name="optimisticProvisioning">
    <Description>
      Set to true to enable optimistic provisioning.  This will cause
      changes to the entitlements compiled from role assignments to be 
      applied immediately to the identity cube rather than waiting
      for the next refresh/reaggregation after the provisioning system
      completes the request.
    </Description>
  </Variable>
  <Variable editable="true" initializer="true" name="foregroundProvisioning">
    <Description>
      Normally provisioning is done in a step that uses the "background"
      option to force the workflow to be suspend and be resumed in a
      background task thread.  This prevents the browser session from
      hanging since provision can sometimes take a long time.  For demos
      and testing it can be better to do this in the foreground so that
      provisioning will have been performed when control is returned to the
      user.  This prevents having to run the Perform Maintenance task to 
      see the results of the request.
    </Description>
  </Variable>
  <Variable initializer="spadmin" input="true" name="fallbackApprover">
    <Description>
      A String that specifies the name of the Identity that will 
      be assigned any approvals where the owner of the approver 
      can't be resolved. Example if the scheme is "owner" and the 
      application doesn't specify and owner.
    </Description>
  </Variable>
  <Variable initializer="LCM" input="true" name="source">
    <Description>
      String version of sailpoint.object.Source to indicate
      where the request originated.  Defaults to LCM.
    </Description>
  </Variable>
  <Variable initializer="false" input="true" name="trace">
    <Description>
      Used for debugging this workflow and when set to true trace
      will be sent to stdout.
    </Description>

       The sequence id of the Identity request object which is stored in 
       the name field of the identity request.
    </Description>
  </Variable>
  <Variable name="cart" output="true">
    <Description>
       This variable includes all ApprovalItems that are part of 
       the request process and is updated during the AfterScript
       of the approval process by assimilating the decisions 
       and comments from the Approvals copy of the ApprovalItem.
    </Description>
  </Variable>
  <Variable initializer="Normal" input="true" name="workItemPriority">
    <Description>
       The String version of a WorkItem.Priority. This variable is
