  <Variable input="true" name="plan">
    <Description>The provisioning plan ready to execute.</Description>

  <Variable input="true" name="flow">
    <Description>The name of the LCM flow that launched this workflow.

      This is one of these three values:

      AccountsRequest
      EntitlementsRequest
      RolesRequest</Description>
  </Variable>
  <Variable editable="true" initializer="false" name="optimisticProvisioning">
    <Description>Set to true to enable optimistic provisioning.  This will cause
      changes to the entitlements compiled from role assignments to be
      applied immediately to the identity cube rather than waiting
      for the next refresh/reaggregation after the provisioning system
      completes the request.</Description>
  </Variable>
  <Variable editable="true" initializer="true" name="foregroundProvisioning">
    <Description>Normally provisioning is done in a step that uses the &amp;quot;background&amp;quot;
      option to force the workflow to be suspend and be resumed in a
      background task thread.  This prevents the browser session from
      hanging since provision can sometimes take a long time.  For demos
      and testing it can be better to do this in the foreground so that
      provisioning will have been performed when control is returned to the
      user.  This prevents having to run the Perform Maintenance task to
      see the results of the request.</Description>

    <Description>Set to true to cause an identity refresh after the changes in the plan
      have been provisioned.  This is normally off, you might want this on
      if you want modification of identity or link attributes to result in
      an immediate re-evaluation of assigned and detected roles.</Description>

        parallel

        we wait for all approvers to approve.  The first approver that
        rejects terminates the entire approval.

    <Description>
      Add arguments as necessary to enable refresh features.  Typically you
      only want this to correlate roles.  Don't ask for provisioning  since that
      can result in provisioning policies that need to be presented and it's
      too late for that.  This is only to get role detection and exception
      entitlements in the cube.
