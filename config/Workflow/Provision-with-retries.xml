<Workflow libraries="Identity,IdentityRequest" name="Provision with retries" type="Subprocess">
  <Variable input="true" name="project" output="true" required="true">
    <Description>
      Project that will be provisioned.
    </Description>
  </Variable>
  <Variable initializer="script:new Integer(60);" input="true" name="provisioningRetryThreshold" type="integer">
    <Description>
      The interval in minutes to wait to retry the request defaults to 
      60 minutes.  The retryInterval will be read from the underlying
      applications involved in the retry provisioning activity and
      the max interval defined across all applications will be used .
      If an interval is not specified on any of the Applications 
      we'll fall back to the setting in this variable which defaultws
      to an hour.
    </Description>
  </Variable>
  <Variable editable="true" initializer="script:new Integer(-1);" input="true" name="provisioningMaxRetries" type="integer">
    <Description>
       The maximum number of retries that will be attempted before failure 
       of the provisioning activities.  A value of -1 will execute
       retries indefinetly.
 
       Like provisioningRetry the value will be read from the
       application, if not defined on the application 
       we'll fall back to this setting which will default to -1.
    </Description>
  </Variable>
  <Variable initializer="false" input="true" name="enableRetryRequest">
    <Description>
      When set to true it will disable the retries loop and let the 
      Provision step launch requests to handle the retries.  Enabling
      this flag will enable some older functionality.
    </Description>
  </Variable>
  <Variable editable="true" initializer="true" input="true" name="foregroundProvisioning">
    <Description>
      Normally provisioning is done in a step that uses the "background"
      option to force the workflow to be suspend and be resumed in a
      background task thread.  This prevents the browser session from
      hanging since provision can sometimes take a long time.  For demos
      and testing it can be better to do this in the foreground so that
      provisioning will have been performed when control is returned to the
      user.  This prevents having to run the Perform Maintenance task to 
      see the resutls of the request.
    </Description>
  </Variable>
  <Variable input="true" name="disableIdentityRequests">
    <Description>
      May be passed by the calling workflow to disable processing of
      IdentityRequest objects after provisioning.  This option should
      be passed by any workflow that is not used by LCM and does not
      maintain the IdentityRequest model.  This avoids logging a warning
      when the IdentityRequest is not found.
    </Description>
  </Variable>
  <Variable input="true" name="identityRequestId">
    <Description>
      The ID of the IdentityRequest for this request.
    </Description>
  </Variable>
  <Variable input="true" name="trace">
    <Description>
      Used for debugging this subprocess and when set to true trace
      statements will be sent to stdout.
    </Description>
  </Variable>
  <Variable name="retries" output="true" type="integer">
    <Description>
       The number of retries performed during the execution
       of the provisioning activities.
    </Description>
  </Variable>
  <Variable name="retryProject">
    <Description>
      Project that is assembled for retry purposes, the parts of
      original plan are broken into a separate plan that includes
      only the account requests that need to be retried.

      After each visit to retr this project will be rebuilt after
      the previous execution results are assimimlated back onto
      the "main" project.
    </Description>
  </Variable>
  <Variable input="true" name="splitProvisioning">
    <Description>
            True to denote this is a partial of the full ProvisioningPlan. This should be true in the case of LCM Provisioning
            splits.

    <Description>
      When visiting for the first time initalize the 
      retry variable and avoid the sleep that we'll 
      want when looping for retries.

  </Step>
  <Step name="Wait for next retry" posX="159" posY="17" wait="ref:retryInterval">
    <Description>
      This is a sleep step and just waits to execute the next step.
      Typically only called when we are retrying to give us some delay
      between calls down to the PE. Skipped during the first loop.

    <Transition to="Provision Retry"/>
  </Step>
  <Step action="call:provisionProject" icon="Provision" name="Provision" posX="258" posY="100">
    <Arg name="project" value="ref:project"/>
    <Arg name="background" value="!ref:foregroundProvisioning"/>
    <Description> 
       Call the typical provisionProject method during our first time
       through the workflow.  If there are retries this step
       will be skipped and should fall into the "Retry Provision"
       step.

       The only thing special here is the flag we specify to
       the PlanEvaluator to prevent the Request object from
       from being created if there are retries in the project.
       Then we can handle them directly in the workflow looping 
       until we are complete.

    <Arg name="disableIdentityRequests" value="ref:disableIdentityRequests"/>
    <Description> 
       Refresh the identity request to include provisioning results and
       any other provisioning side effects in the project.
       
       Note that the disableIdentityRequests input variable is passed
       to skip request processing if we're being called from a non-LCM workflow.
       It is easier to pass this option than to transition around this step.

    <Description> 
       Call retryProvisionProject method that will retry the plans
